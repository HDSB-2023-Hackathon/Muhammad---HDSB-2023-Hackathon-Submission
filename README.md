So this is the zip file of our project named Claculator and this is a math kit.
You will get a a normal and scientific calculator in it. You can also plot line on a graph according to the cordinates and and in the last feature you can get 
Standard form and slope intercept form from cordinates and you will also see the dot on the graph accourding your cordinates.

We didn't had enough time to design the program but it is full user-friendly and it is also fully accurate. It is very self explaining project.
